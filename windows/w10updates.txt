These are steps I took after I upgraded my windows 10 machine and
got Ubuntu installed from the Windows Store:

- This will update git to the latest version
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

To generate a ssh-key for both my github and vsts accounts I had
to execute the following command:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my-email@address.com"
